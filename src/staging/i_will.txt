I WILL

by Lennon/McCartney


      G        Em        Am         D
Who knows how long I've loved you?
     G      Em       Bm
You know I love you still.
 G7     C      D      Em       Am  G
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?
        C       D    G    Em  Am  D
If you want me to I will.

    C          D     Em
   Love you forever and forever,
    C            D       G
   Love you with all my heart.
    C           D     Em
   Love you whenever we're together,
    A                    D
   Love you when we're apart.


For if I ever saw you,
I didn't catch your name.
But it never really mattered;
I will always feel the same.

   Love you forever and forever, etc.

And when at last I find you,
A song will fill the air.
Sing it loud so I can hear you.
Make it easy to endear you to me,
Ah, you know I will.
