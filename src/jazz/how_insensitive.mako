	DONE:
	- brought in the real book epdf.
	- filled in the meta data from the real book.
	- put in the tunes structure.
	- put in the real book chords.
	- brought in the fake book epdf.
	- filled in the meta data from the fake book.
	- put in the real book tune.
	- checked the real book chords.
	- checked the real book tune.
	- put in the real book lyrics.
	- checked the real book lyrics.
	- played the real book version to hear that it sounds well.
	- put in you tube performances with documentation.
	- put in a lyrics url.
	- add the fake book chords.
	- add the fake book tune.
	- add the fake book lyrics.
	- check the fake book chords.
	- check the fake book tune.
	- check the fake book lyrics.
	- heard the fake book version.
	TODO:
	- this song has two poets one for the original portugese and one for english. This is not reflected in the output,
		make it not so.
	- in the real book version of the chords in the B section the des:7 should come in the middle of the bar and I
		have no way to indicate that. The original real book score does indicate that using tempo markings.
		Find out how to do that in lilypond and do it.
	- how do I put the last two chords in the real book version (the turn around chords) in parenthesis?
	REMARKS:
	- this tunes structure can also be categorised as "ABAC" since the first 8 bars of both the first and second part are the same.
	- this tune was written in the real book under a C major scale (or A minor scale) where the B is always flat.
		Obviously this is a serious mistake.
	- I added two turn around chords that were missing in the real book version.
