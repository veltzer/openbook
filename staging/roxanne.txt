Roxanne lyrics

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Those days are over
You don't have to sell your body to the night
Roxanne
You don't have to wear that dress tonight
Walk the streets for money
You don't care if it's wrong or if it's right

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light

I loved you since I knew you
I wouldn't talk down to you
I have to tell you just how I feel
I won't share you with another boy
I know my mind is made up
So put away your makeup
[ From: http://www.elyrics.net/read/p/police-lyrics/roxanne-lyrics.html]
Told you once I won't tell you again
It's a bad way

Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne
You don't have to put on the red light

You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
You don't have to put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
Roxanne put on the red light
