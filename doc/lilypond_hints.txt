Melody:
=======
- in order to parenthesize notes: <\parenthesize e'>4
	This is just for a single note? how do I put parens on more than one note?
	It does not work to put two notes inside the <\parenthesize> block.
- in order to emphasize notes or other articulation: e->, e-. e-^ etc...
- in order to add piano fingerings use: e-4
- in order to play two or three notes together use: <c e g>8
- in order to do ties use: g~ | g
- in order to do triplets use: \times 2/3 { c4 e g }
- in order to do polyphonics use: << { first part } \\ { second part } >>
	see "she_loves_you" by the beatles.
- in order to do pharses: put "(" AFTER the first note that starts the phrase (NOT BEFORE).
	and put ")" after the note that ends the phrase.
- when you want to put a sharp/flat/bekar sign even though it is not needed (just as a reminder
	to the player) use the "!" sign on the note on which to put it.
	example: d!4
- rests: "r2." looks diffrent on the page than "r2 r4". do with this information what you will.
- beams: sometimes lilypond beams are not that smart. For instance in Jazz certain passages are fast
	and should be connected by one beam but since the melody rises and falls lilypond decides
	to connect it with one beam. In order to get around it use manual beams this way:
	b8.[ b16 a8. g16] a8
- putting a "Fine" mark in the tune:
	g1~ \mark \markup { \italic { Fine } }
	This will put the Fine on top of the staff.
	If you want it below the staff then use:
	g1  | r4_\markup { \italic { Fine } }
- putting "small" gliding notes
	just use on of \grace \acciaccatura \appoggiatura. See the suicide_tango tune.
	References: http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.14/Documentation/notation/special-rhythmic-concerns
	Notes:
	- if you use one of these before an "\alternative" to voltas you will get indiscrepency
		between the voltas of the chords and melody. To avoid this use the special notation mentioned
		here in the bar *BEFORE* the alternative. See the suicide_tango tune.
	- all of these (grace, acciaccature, ...) seem to interfere with line breaks. Haven't figured
		this one out yet.

Chords:
=======
- when you don't want a chord put r if you want N.C. to be printed and s if you
want nothing to be printed.
- alternate bass to a chord: c2:m7/bes
- \chords is akin to \new ChordNames but with something else... What is it?
	find out from the lilypond documentation...
- \chords and \chordmode is different. It seems that \chords creates two tracks in midi
	while \chordmode creates only one. only use \chordmode.
- adding notes to chords: c:5.9 is a regular C chord with a D added in. This is different from
c:9 which is c:7.9 which is correct for jazz but not for rock.
- a single chord on more than one bar:
	ees1*2:maj7
	Note that the chord which is doubled MUST have length (you cant just write ees*2 and assume
	that the base of multiplication will be taken from the previous chord).
	This seems a like a bug in lilypond, is it?
	* the chord after this chord, if not annotated for length, will be considered multiplied
	as well. take heed.
	If you want weird durations, say the same chord over 11 beats then write: g4*11:7.9-.
- how do I mark out a 9 chord? if I do a:7.9 it shows up as a9 on the music page and not as a7/9.
	- first, is there a way to make a7/9 appear on the page?
	- what is the right way to mark a 9 chord?
	So basically marking out a:7.9 or a:9 is the same on the page...
	For jazz this is fine (every jazz musician seeing A9 knows to play A:7.9).
- altered chords:
	mark them out as: "7.3-.5-.9-.11-.13-". I know its weird.
		The 3- is for the 9+ and the 11- is for the real third. Ugly.
	But don't worry I have my own chord exception that will print this out nicely as "7alt".
	See discussion at: http://www.mail-archive.com/lilypond-user@gnu.org/msg48542.html
- sus chords:
	mark them out as "7.11".
	My own exception will handle this and will print it out as "7sus".
	This seems to be the correct definition of a sus chord (4'th note suspended) in Jazz according
	to wikipedia and my own experience. 2 sus is rarely used in jazz and usually marked as sus2 or sus9.
- minor/major chords:
	a:m7+
	see discussion on:
	http://osdir.com/ml/lilypond-user-gnu/2009-09/msg00254.html
- maj9 chords:
	either c:maj9 or c:maj7.9 (both appear the same on the page).
- diminished chords.
	if you just want the little circle (not dim7 but just the circle) then use "dim":
	aes:dim
	if you want the little circle with 7 next to it then use "dim7":
	aes:dim7

questions:
- how do I put chords in parenthesis? I still do not know.
	- <\parenthesize bes:7> does not work
	- ( bes:7 ) does not work either.
  I have couple of tunes that need this.
- how do I do 4-3, 9-8 or other similar chords?

Frets:
======
- in order to put guitar chord notations just use:
	\include "predefined-guitar-fretboards.ly"
	\new FretBoards {
		\chordmode {
			[chords go here]	
		}
	}
  The problem with this is that you wind up repeating the chord names yet again just for the
  guitar diagrams. There is a way to share. Define a name for the chords and then reuse that name
  inside the FretBoards section.
- in order to define your own fretboards use something like:
	\storePredefinedDiagram #default-fret-table \chordmode {g:sus4} #guitar-tuning #"3-3;2-2;o;o;o;3-4;"
	look at "src/rock/talking_bout_a_revolution.mako"
	
Tempo:
======
- cut time:
	\set Staff.timeSignatureFraction=#'(2 . 2)
        \time 4/4
	see "My Romance" for a use case.
	(the spaces are CRITICAL!)

	Another way is:

	\once \override Staff.TimeSignature #'stencil = #ly:text-interface::print
        \once \override Staff.TimeSignature #'text = \markup \musicglyph #"timesig.C22"
        \time 4/4

	See discussion here:
	http://old.nabble.com/using-the-cut-time-symbol-for-4-2-etc.-td18200303.html
- one way is:
	==== SNIP ====
	\tempo "Andante" 4 = 88
	==== SNIP ====
	at the top voice. This will create the right notation on the page
	AND determine the speed that the midi plays in.
	Advantages:
		- only one place that works for both print and midi, AND has the advantage
		of showing the right way in the print version.
	Disadvantages:
		- You need to map name of the speed to BPM or skip the BPM or name of speed
		entirely. You can use a lookup table like mine:
		http://veltzer.net/blog/blog/2010/08/14/musical-tempo-table/
- another way is:
	==== SNIP ====
	\context {
		\Score
		tempoWholesPerMinute = #(ly:make-moment 130 4)
	}
	==== SNIP ====
	at the midi section. This only determines the midi speed and has no effect on the
	print version.
	Advantages:
		- fine tuning the midi with no effect on other parts.
	Disadvantages:
		- can cause discrepency between the print version and the midi version. If
		you want to keep those two in sync without worrying you better use the \tempo
		method.

Lyrics
======
- breaking up lyrics:
	eve -- ry day I write the book 
		eve - will be on the first note
		ry - will be on the second one.
- one syllable or word on a couple of notes:
	I'm with you rain _ or shine!
	rain will be on two notes (rain _ _ will be placed on three notes).
- several words over a single note:
	connect them with an underscore like this:
	The_blue
	The underscore will NOT show up in the print.
	I'm not sure if it's official but it works.
- one word or syllable over multiple notes:
	simply write many _ (one for each note you are waiting for...).
	This means that the previous word is to be sung over all of those notes.
- word continuing over a beamed note:
	"round a pug -- nosed dream. __"
	note the space before the '__'.
- quoting in lyrics:
	either use single quotes which give no problem:
	He said 'hello'
	or use double quotes this way:
	He said "\"hello\""
	I know it's weird.
	If you want to print ["Hello"] you can do "\""Hello"\"" or "\"" Hello "\"".
	The first one will show as "\""Hello"\"" and the second as " Hello ". Both are not what you want.
	See "have you met miss jones" for an example.
- setting the fonts for the lyrics:
	\override Score . LyricText #'font-size = #-3
- not singing even though there is music (real no lyrics):
	I still don't know how to do this. This is useful when there are voltas.
	A single _ seems to work (look at a_fine_romance lyrics) but I don't know if this is official.
- how to handle voltas in lyrics:
	Simply write the parts in the "wrong" order.
	If parts are A { B, C }
	then write them as one lyrics block which goes A B C (as opposed to A B A C).
	If parts are A B C D where B is the first volta and D is the second then write two lyrics blocks:
		A B D    and     C.
	See "they_all_laughed" for an example.
- one word over a note with arcs:
	Actually you dont need to do anything in order to do this.
	If you really want to see lyrics with outstreched line like this___ then add __ after the relevant lyrics.
	See "they_all_laughed" for an example.
- comments in the text:
	Just like regular comments in lilypond (%% at the start of the line).
- combinations. Sometimes you want to break up a work but also have the first syllable span more
	than one note. In that case you must put the -- before the _ like this:
	af -- _ _ ter
	The other way will NOT work:
	af _ _  -- ter
	Is this a bug in lilypond?!?
- broken up word at the end of the tune:
	Look at "Flamingo" for this. It has the prefix of the last word
	at the end of the tune and it is supposed to join the suffix of that same word at the begining.
	We could end the tune with "Fla --" with no other part but lilypond gives errors for this.
- punctuation:
	If you have punctuation in the text then you need to attch it to the preceding word or
	syllable, otherwise it will get it's own note in the melody (which is probably not what
	you want).
- easily editing hebrew in lyrics:
	It is pretty hard to edit hebrew from within vi so use some other software (say gedit)
	for that work.

Midi production
===============
- if you have multiple scores in one file then you will need multipl \midi statements which
will lead to multiple midi files produced when that file gets processed.

- Is there a way to catenates all the midi files from within lilypond? (tell lilypond that all midi should come out in a single midi file?)

- setting instruments for midi production
	list of instruments can be found at
	http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.11/Documentation/user/lilypond/MIDI-instruments#MIDI-instruments
	for chords:
	\set ChordNames.midiInstrument = #"acoustic grand"
	for melody:
	\set Staff.midiInstrument = #"flute"
- setting midi volumes
	\set Staff.midiMinimumVolume = #0.7
	\set Staff.midiMaximumVolume = #0.9
	* first note of the staff MUST be accompanied with dynamic symbols.
	see suicide_tango as example.
	References:
	http://lilypond.org/doc/v2.12/Documentation/user/lilypond/Controlling-MIDI-dynamics
	The problem is I do not seem to be able to balance accompaniment and lead.
	see suicide_tango as example.

Documentation for lilypond:
===========================
- A snipplet repository: http://lsr.dsi.unimi.it/
- A good pdf: http://wikitex.org/doc/lilypond.pdf
- some tips and tricks for lilypond: http://www.geoffhorton.com/lilypond.html

Doing nothing in lilypond
=========================
Lets say you want a macro that does nothing (You may want it to do something in the future).
If you do:
myMacro=
Then you will get errors. The only way I found so far to get over this issue is to do:
myMacro={}
Which seems to work.

Maybe there is a better way?
	- an official lilypond operation that does nothing?!?
	- a scheme macro?!?

repetitions:
If you have a repeat which ends EXACTLY where a part ends the \endPart or \bar will trample the special
marks for repetition. Removed the \endPart.

book creation in lilypond:
==========================
- you must use \bookpart! why? because if you put your tunes without \bookpart then the layout algorithm will
work for the ENTIRE book which is WAY SLOW (25 minutes on 40 jazz standards). So use \bookpart!
- if you want a book part with no score you can just have a \header in it and it will show up. The thing is that
you must have some markup in order for it to show up (even a \markup { \null } will do...) and you must have
headers enabled (ofcourse).

meta data:
==========
- quoting in the meta data. If you want to quote in meta data then for now you have to use single quotes
	and not double. I can fix that and allow double quotes but currently it is not supported.
	look at the subtitle of "A Foggy Day" if you want to see an example. You can try to change it
	to double quotes to see what happens and try to fix the system to support double quotes (maybe
	through a python function to quote strings?!?)
