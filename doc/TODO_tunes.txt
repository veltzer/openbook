Jazz:
=====
ruby my dear (monk).
equinox (a kind of minor blues by John Coltrane)
tenderly
like someone in love.
star eyes
serenade to a cuckoo
scrapple from the apple
ornithology
night and day
my ship
my one and only love
the more I see you
it don't mean a thing
isn't it romantic?
in a sentimental mood
I remember April
I love you
god bless the child
epistrophy
don't get around much anymore
donna lee
don't blame me
dancing on the ceiling
could it be you
confirmation
cherokee
blue train
bluesette
blue monk
blue in green
black orpheus
autumn in new york
as time goes by
angel eyes
all of you
all blues
a night in tunisia
take the "A" train.
Tenderly
Who can I turn to?
Moonlight in Vermont
all or nothing at all
waltz for debby
moments notice
blues for Alice
A ghost of a chance
new york, new york.
some where over the rainbow
