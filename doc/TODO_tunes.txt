Jazz:
=====
A ghost of a chance
a night in tunisia
all blues
all of you
all or nothing at all
angel eyes
black orpheus
blue in green
blue monk
blue train
blues for Alice
bluesette
cherokee
confirmation
could it be you
dancing on the ceiling
don't blame me
don't get around much anymore
epistrophy
equinox (a kind of minor blues by John Coltrane)
god bless the child
I love you
I remember April
in a sentimental mood
it don't mean a thing
like someone in love.
moments notice
moonlight in vermont
my one and only love
my ship
new york, new york.
night and day
ornithology
ruby my dear (monk).
satin doll
scrapple from the apple
some where over the rainbow
star eyes
Tenderly
the more I see you
waltz for debby
Who can I turn to?
