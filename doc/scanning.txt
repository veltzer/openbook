This is a small guide on how to scan in ubuntu
==============================================

* why do you need this?
because I want to scan real sheet music for reference.

* best program to use.
	xsane (you can just run it off the command line or via
		applications->graphics->xsane).
	settings:
		color, grey, lineart:
			lineart is bad (in terms of quality).
			I find grey is good for me.
	scan resolution: 100 usuallly is good enough.

	You can scan to jpg or pdf.
	For the openbook project pdf is the right format.

PDF manipulation:
=================
rotation by 180 degrees:
pdf180 /tmp/scan0004.pdf
joining pdfs:
pdfjoin [first pdf] [second pdf]
or better:
/usr/bin/pdfjam --fitpaper 'true' --suffix joined -- [first pdf] - [second pdf] -
