- midi translation does not respect voltas. If I have: A V1 A V2 Then midi will play: A V1 V2 which sounds bad.

- lyrics do not respect voltas (you can see the ugliness of the situation in autumn leaves).

- voltas and bows. When the last note before alternatives has a bow to the next note, then
the first note of the second (third, forth,...) alternative should have a bow coming into
it as well. As a side effect this also affects lyrics and midi (midi will play the note twice in the second round and lyrics will put a syllable on it even though it does not deserve one).

- when playing in timidity the channel for the voice is seen as "\new" while the channel for the chords looks like "mychords" (which is the name I gave it). Why is that?!?

- When I have a relative tune with the following structure:

	repeat volta 2  {
		A
	}
	alternative {
		{	B	}
		{	C	}
	}

Then C begins relativly to B and not to A! This is NOT how the music is played out. The music plays ABAC and so C should be relative to A.

- when catenating two tunes then the names of the first tune appears but not the second.

- catenating lots of tunes and trying to produce a pdf out of that takes way too much time (looks like a processing algorithm bug).

- there is no lilypond flag to tell lilypond to turn warnings into errors (like -Werror in gcc). This is a very bad idea for someone
who wants to make sure his lilypond files are clean.

- lilypond takes forever to process my book. This is a real bug!
	Probably some algorithm is doing some exhostive search which turns out to be in a big space in my case.

- is there a way for book parts not to do page breaks?

- ties in chords. If I have a chord over a strange period of time or over a bar line then adding tie to it like this "g7 c~ | c"
	does not help in the sense that midi will still play the chord twice.
