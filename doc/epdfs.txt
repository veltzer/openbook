How to collect these ?
- go to:
	~/links/topics_archive/music_education/jazz/collections
	There you will find the 3 index files for the jazz real books and more.
		RB1C.pdf
		RB2C.pdf
		RB3C.pdf
	open them using document viewer on Ubuntu (gnome-open [filename]).
	Then find the page and file you need it from.
	The real files are:
		The Real Book of Jazz Volume I.pdf
		The Real Book of Jazz Volume II.pdf
		The Real Book of Jazz Volume III.pdf
	Open it too using the same tool.
	Then print to a file selecting only the page(s) you need.

	The book that I have is called:
		Jazz Fake Book.pdf
	and it is also quite good.
	When printing from this book with page number use an offset of -1.
	Meaning if you want to print pages 76-80 print the pages 75-79.
- scan from my own fakebooks.
	I usually use xsane for this.
