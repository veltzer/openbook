The issue of pdf size is very important in this project since we want the smallest
possible pdf but with high quality.

Method 1 (WE DONT USE THIS)
========
pdf2ps and then ps2pdf
It turns out we can reduce from ~9MB to 2MB this way!!!
It turns out that the reason we get this huge reduction is because this conversion
loses all links in the document and there are plenty of them of type textedit:// (one
for every note). So readlly this size reduction is a round about way of getting
ridd of the textexit:// links which make the pdf larger. Not a very good idea.
In addition this method is also reducing the quality of the fonts and document.

Method 2 (WE DONT USE THIS)
========
gs -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.4 -dPDFSETTINGS=/screen -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH  -dQUIET -sOutputFile=gs.pdf openbook.pdf
does not reduce the size of the file

Method 3 (WE USE THIS BUT NOT FOR SIZE REASONS)
========
qpdf --linearize openbook.pdf qpdf.pdf
does not reduce the size
it does, however, linearize the file making the file work better over the web (see pdf_and_web.txt for details).

Method 4 (WE DONT USE THIS)
========
convert openbook.pdf -compress Zip convert.pdf
Reduces the size by half but the output is ugly and pixelized.

Method 5 (WE DONT USE THIS)
========
pdftk openbook.pdf output pdftk.pdf compress
does not reduce the size of the file

Method 6 (WE DONT USE THIS)
========
pdftocairo -pdf out/openbook.pdf /tmp/try.pdf
turns the pdf into a pdf containing a collection of images in some format.
makes the file bigger but sometimes easier to draw. grew to 8MB from 2MB in one attempt.

Method 7 (WE USE THIS)
========
Remove the textedit:// links which lilypond is sticking in the pdf document FOR EVERY NOTE.
This is a huge size consumer.
The way to do this is by having: \pointAndClickOff somewhere in the lilypond file.
The quality of the pdf is, ofcourse, not affected by this option.

Method 8 (WE DONT USE THIS)
========
There a google tool which is supposed to reduce the size of pdfs. I still haven't tried it
so I can't comment on whether it reduces the size of the file, causes quality degredation,
hard to install and use etc.
