These are hints about using the openbook build system:
======================================================
If you want to build a single tune use this:
make out/src/israeli/hardufim.stamp
or
make out/src/jazz/a_foggy_day.pdf

If you want to build all rock songs use this:
make all_tunes_rock

If you want to build all jazz songs use this:
make all_tunes_jazz

if you want to try to build all tunes with no regard to lilypond output:
DO_STOP_OUTPUT=0 make all_tunes

if you want to cut an external pdf use (you must have the external pdfs in the right place):
make out/src/jazz/a_foggy_day.[0-9].pdf
or
make out/src/jazz/[tune].0.pdf
