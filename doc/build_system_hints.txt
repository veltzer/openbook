These are hints about using the openbook build system:
======================================================
If you want to build a single tune use this:
	$ make out/[source without .ly.mako].stamp
example:
	$ make out/src/openbook/a_foggy_day.stamp
this will build: ly, midi, ps, pdf, stamp

If you just want to build a pdf use this:
	$ make out/[source without .ly.mako].pdf
example:
	$ make out/src/openbook/a_foggy_day.pdf
this is guaranteed to build the pdf for the required tune
but may also build other products as well (and currently does).

If you want to build all rock songs use this:
	$ make all_tunes_rock

If you want to build all jazz songs use this:
	$ make all_tunes_jazz

if you want to try to build all tunes with no regard to lilypond output:
	$ DO_STOP_OUTPUT=0 make all_tunes

if you want to cut an external pdf use (you must have the external pdfs in the right place):
	$ make out/src/openbook/a_foggy_day.[0-9].pdf
or
	$ make out/src/openbook/[tune].0.pdf
