Here are some policy descision:
===============================

general:
========
- we are using a rich preprocessing/templating system. Reasons are:
	- we want lilypond to see the minimum information to render the result.
	- we would like to use the same file as the source for many different lilypond
	renderings.
	- we would like to use the same file as the source of many versions of the same tune.
	- we would like to have only infomation that pertains to the tune to be in the tune
	file. All the rest should be handled by the framework.
	Currently we are using pythons Mako.
- we are not using lilypond includes but rather the preprocessing system for includes because:
	- we may want to control from the outside what is included and what is not.
	- we would like to produce, for each tune, a single lilypond file that can be used
	by an outsider to edit and produce a different output.
- all includes are root relative.
	- that way there is no ambiguity.
	- that way we can easily, on the command line, do tests.
- "make check_all" should pass with no error. This is currently not part of the build and needs
	to be checked manually but hopefully in the future it will be.

comments:
=========
In the lilypond section comments should start with %% and not one (%). The main reason is to avoid
the chance of collision with future or current templating systems that may use a single % as a directive.

name of files:
==============
If a song is called "Autumn Leaves" it will be in a file called "autumn_leaves.mako".
- spaces are replaced by underscores.
- all low case.
- apostrophes, and any other special punctuation marks, are removed. examples:
	"Gloria's Step" -> "glorias_step.mako"
	"Hallelujah I Love Him (Her) So" -> "hallelujah_i_love_him_her_so.mako"

This alteration has the following advantages:
	- it is deterministic and could be implemented using a three line function in
	almost any programming language.
	- it prevents all problems with case sensitive vs case insensitive file systems
	(this really means brain dead Microsoft systems).
	- it prevents shell scripting problems because it lacks spaces. Obviously one
	can circumvent these types of problems using correct escaping or quoting in
	coding such scripts but I don't see a reason to complicate things when a much
	simpler solution exists.

meta data:
==========
- if a song has more than one poet or composer they will be written without "&" but
rather as a list of names catenated by ",":
	attributes['composer']="Cootie Williams, Thelonious Monk"
rationale: this will enable further processing by python code by splitting the list and understanding who
	the different composers/poets are.

overall song structure:
=======================
- order between parts:
	first chords.
	then voice.
	at the end text.
- breaks.
	Use the \myBreak macro at every line end in the chords in the tune do nothing.
	This may turn to a break or it may not.
	This lets lilypond dictate the breaks. Only change when lilypond makes bad descisions.
- bars
	Don't do any extra special bars (\bar "||" or the like). It just overloads the music.
	Mark stuff with \myMark "A", \myMark "B" etc for parts but that's it.
	At the end of the piece put an ending mark (\bar "|."). My convention is to have this mark at the end of the chords and not the tune. It seems that lilypond does not do that by default. (Why? Is that a bug that I should report?!?).

Chords:
=======
- should we put bar lines in chords? yes
	advantages: (selected)
		It makes the chords easier to read.
		It makes it very easy to see on the resulting sheet when you didnt time the chords right
			(bar lines appear where they should not)
		It makes lilypond give you errors about the timings (which is good).
		I consider the bar lines as sort of documentation when writing chords.
	disadvantages:
		They are not taken into consideration
		They make the code longer
		In Jazz tunes the lines (usually 4 chords) are very well defined
			and the chord layout will be visible from the lines
			so bar lines are superfluous.
- if a partial bar starts the tune the chords in it should
	be marked as 's' and not 'r'. 'r' will cause N.C. to
	be printed while 's' causes nothing to be printed.
	Use 'r' only when there is really no chord for that part of the tune (very rare).
- should we end with a turn around? yes
	advantages: (selected)
		- maybe some people don't know how to turn around.
		- sometime the turn around is not trivial (there are many types of turn around we must remember).
		- sometime the turn around is not anywhere in the song.
		- sometime the previous two reasons persist.
	disadvantages:
		- sounds bad at the very end of the music (in midi for instance).
		- musicians know how to do turn arounds.
		- an example of a turn around is usually available. This is especially
		true for an AABA song where at least one turn around is always there (between
		the first and the second A parts).
- marking of parts ("A", "B") should be done within the chord section.
	rationale: less clutter and the chords define the structure more than the melody.
- marking the start of chords, parts, end of parts, start of song, end of song should be done in the chord section.
	Use: \startChords, \endChords, \startPart, \endPart
	rationale: less clutter and the chords define the structure more than the melody.
- use "d:m7" and not "d:min7" (shorter).
	This is enforced by the style checker.
- do NOT use repears ( | r1 | ) in chords. If you don't want the chords to repeat there
	is a better way to do it: write a1*2:7 to have the A7 chord last two bars.
- use "a:dim7" and not "a:dim" to denote a 4 note diminished chord.
	Reasons for:
		It shows dim7 in the sheet which is what books usually do.
		It allow to distinguish the 4 note chord from the 3 note chord.
	Reasons against:
		It looks a bit ugly ("Ao7") on the page.
		It may not be the right way in lilypond to do it.
	* I need to rethink this policy (maybe alter the way chords are specified in lilypond).
- use "a:13" to denote a 13 chord.
	On the page it will be shown as "a9/add13" which is sort of ok.

Tune:
=====
- should be written using the \relative directive.
	reasons:
	- jazz tunes rarely jump a lot so this is a good solution for jazz.
	- less cluter, easier to maintain).
	- easier to move an octave lower or higher.
	- easier to transpose.
- \relative should be to c (middle c).
	in this method the first note sets the octave for the entire tune.
	reasons:
	- all tunes have some relation one to the other and can be compared and transposed in the same way.
- ties should be written this way "a~ b" or "a~ | b". Meaning that the tie is right
	next to the note from which the tie eminates with no space.
	Need to find a rationale for this currently this is just a convention.

Lyrics:
=======
- the lyrics should be done under \lyricmode and not \lyrics
	(I'm not sure why that should be so but it is the current convention).
- quotations in lyrics
	you cannot put the quotes in double quotation marks (") since that will cause the
	lyrics to come out wrong, instead I used single quotation marks (').
- Lyrics and midi
	- I did not render the lyrics for midi. It seems that could be beneficial for Karaoke or various other uses. In any case I have yet to see this work right since timidity does not render it well (could be a problem with timidity or maybe a problem with lilyponds rendering of the lyrics for midi...).
- Song titles in lyrics
	- When a song's title occurs in the lyrics, the initial letters of each word of the title should be capitalized. For example: "Don't know why there's no sun up in the sky, Stormy Weather,"

Completeness:
=============
0 - unknown
1 - infrastructure (compilation) is ok. Uses my conventions.
2 - basic info is there. Could look bad.
3 - at least one component of tune/lyrics/harmony is ok.
4 - at least two components of tune/lyrics/harmony are ok.
5 - all three components of tune/lyrics/harmony are ok.
